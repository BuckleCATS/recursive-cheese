# Recursive Cheese
![Cheese](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77944679/189460289-dccafdb3-e027-423e-81c9-625836558c93.png)

This script demonstrates the memory limitations of object-oriented recursion. This script can be used for educational purposes. After the function is done calling itself, a new block of cheese is generated at the end of each function call!

LIMITATION: After a certain period of time, the computer will crash due to a cheese memory leak.
